Alberto would like to thank you:

* Greg Ward for his work on btparse and Text::BibTeX. He is not
  maintaining this code anymore but without his work none of these
  software packages were possible.

* Philip Kime for his continuous support on my work when porting from
  0.38 to 0.40

* Jens Rehsack and Jerome Quelin for building patchs.
