btparse - a C library to parse BibTeX files
version 0.34 (25 October, 2003)
                                    
btparse is the C component of btOOL, a pair of libraries for parsing and
processing BibTeX files.  It can be used in standalone C programs, or as
the backend to the companion Perl library, Text::BibTeX.

btparse is built on top of a lexical analyzer and parser constructed
using PCCTS (the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set), which provides
efficient, reliable parsing with excellent error detection, reporting,
and recovery.  The library provides entry points to the parser,
functions to traverse and query the abstract-syntax tree that it
produces, and some functions for processing strings in "the BibTeX way".
The only requirement for building the library is an ANSI-compliant C
compiler.  In particular, you do *not* need PCCTS, because enough of it
is included in the distribution to build btparse.  (Of course, if you
play with the grammar file (bibtex.g), then you will need PCCTS to
re-build the library.  If you do this, though, you should know what
you're doing and already have PCCTS.)


AVAILABILITY
------------

You can find the latest version of both components of btOOL (btparse and
Text::BibTeX), as well as up-to-date information on btOOL, at:

Here you will find HTML versions of the documentation, a technical
report describing the project, links to download the code, and whatever
other goodies I can come up with over time.
