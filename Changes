0.40_2 2010-02-15
 * merged btparse library into Text::BibTeX code. I am sorry for all

   suggestion is that they make Text::BibTeX as a dependency.
 * ported compilation and configuration tools from ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   to Module::Build.
 * back on track, trying to make Text::BibTeX work and compile easily
   on main platforms (sorry, for main platforms I assume Linux, Mac OS

   Created a THANKS file for this purpose.

 * the way the module initializes changed. Now the module can be
   included to check its version.

0.33 2000-03-22
 * fixed long-standing bug with import/inheritance code; should fix the
   mysterious "method redefined" and "can't locate object method" errors
   that various people have seen on various platforms over the years.
   Thanks to Nikolay Pelov <Nikolay.Pelov@cs.kuleuven.ac.be> for
   fixing the bug!
 * fixed some small bugs spotted by Horst Tellioglu
   <telliogl@h2hobel.phl.univie.ac.at> that messed up creating a brand-
   new entry from scratch
 * fixed even smaller bug spotted by Horst Tellioglu in the BibTeX 0.99
   emulation code

0.32 1999-11-28
 * made Makefile.PL able to download and configure btparse, instead
   of leaving it up to the user
 * fixed entry output method (print_s) so strings are wrapped in braces,
   not quotes -- that way we don't generate bogus BibTeX files if there
   are quotes at top-level in a string

0.31 1999-10-28
 * fixed small bug in Text::BibTeX::BibFormat
 * better documentation for Text::BibTeX::Name example
 * better adherence to POD standard

0.30 1999-03-12
 * the "structure module" system is in place -- lets you write classes
   analogous to BibTeX style files, but with all the advantages of
   object-oriented programming in Perl (see Text::BibTeX::Structure
   man page)
 * the Bib structure, meant to emulate the standard style files of
   BibTeX 0.99, is partially complete: can generate sort keys for
   any of the 13 standard entry types, and format 'article' and 'book'
   entries -- no support for crossrefs or alphabetic labels yet though
 * can now (optionally) access the data in more "raw" form, ie. with
   macros not expanded, strings not concatenated, whitespace not collapsed)
   (see Text::BibTeX::Value man page)
 * moved support for parsing individual names to the Text::BibTeX::Name class
 * added support for name-formatting via Text::BibTeX::NameFormat class
   (parallels work in btparse -- see also bt_format_names man page)
 * added BibTeX-style string purificaction
 * added three example programs: btcheck, btsort, and btformat (btformat
   is *very* preliminary!)
 * lots of documentation added/revised in the existing modules

0.21 1997-10-20
 * companion to btparse 0.21 -- mainly due to bug fixes and one
   minor interface change (bt_cite_key -> bt_entry_key) in btparse
 * documentation/portability/warning fixes
 * fixed XS code to not make an accidental second "strip quote
   characters" pass
 * fixed Entry 'print_s' method to handle all entry metatypes
 * changed Entry 'delete' method to handle a list of fields
 * started introducing changes to support the new way of
   doing 'structure modules' -- nothing documented yet, though
 * deprecated old Structure module

0.2 1997-09-08
 * fixed a bunch of little memory leaks in the btparse C library
 * rationalized the Text::BibTeX::Entry method names
 * added (incomplete) Text::BibTeX::Structure module
 * completely overhauled the parser and the interface to it;
   this necessitated many small changes to BibTeX.xs
 * greatly expanded the test suite and fixed a few little bugs
   found in the process
 * fixed the XS code to handle comment and preamble entries

0.1 1997-03-08
 * initial release
